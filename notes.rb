      # [g2, g4]
      # [d8, h4]

  # change columns to letters

  # HumanPlayer class
  # HumanPlayer#play_turn
  #
  # ComputerPlayer class
  # make sure this can be cleanly inserted for later

#Hardening code
  # DRY it out
  # split classes into separate files
  # exception handling for bad user input
  # method decomposition (pull chunks of code into "helper methods")
  # make "helper" methods private
  # jazz up UI with colorize and unicode

#Optional
  # en passant
  # castling
  # draws
  # pawn promotion
